Linear Regression Project:-

Overview:

This repository contains a Linear Regression model built to predict output values with an accuracy of 85%. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier visualization, and model training to enhance prediction accuracy.


Features:-

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed to understand data distribution and relationships.

Outlier Detection & Visualization: Identified and visualized outliers to improve model performance.

Linear Regression Model: Implemented a regression model to predict output values.

Model Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy of 85% on test data.


Technologies Used:-

Python.

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling).

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization).

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Model).


Usage:-

Load the dataset and perform EDA.

Visualize outliers and clean the data.

Train the Linear Regression model.

Evaluate model performance and make predictions.



Results:-

Achieved 85% accuracy on the test dataset.

Improved predictions by handling outliers and performing feature engineering.



Contributing:-

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
